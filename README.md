# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m an aspiring cybersecurity analyst with CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications, showcasing practical skills through these projects. Currently studying for CISSP and seeking opportunities in IT support and cybersecurity.

## Projects
- **[Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus](/Vulnerability_Scanning_Nessus)**  
  Scanned a test environment, identified vulnerabilities, and documented fixes.   
- **[Python Port Scanner](/Python_Port_Scanner)**  
  Developed an advanced port scanner with parallel scanning, service detection (e.g., RPC, SMB), and file output capabilities. 
- **[Security Policy Document](/Security_Policy)**  
  Wrote a policy on password management and incident response.
- **[AWS IAM Project: Access Control and Authentication](/AWS)**
  This project demonstrates how to use AWS IAM to manage users, groups, and permissions securely. I created two users and two groups to enforce the    principle of least privilege and added MFA for extra security.
